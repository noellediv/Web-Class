       father taught her about the wonders of the world and the glory of traveling the world, this sparked her in travels and culture. Bath's mother 
       sparked her interest in chemistry by buying her a chemistry set. Therefore, with all her hard work she became one of the few lucky kids to  attend 
       a cancer research workshop at age 16. At the event, Dr. Robert Benard was so impressed with her work he helped her win <i> Mademoiselle </i>
       magazine's Merit award in 1960. Bath graduated highschool in two years. She then went to Hunter College where she got her bachelor's degree by 1964.

       sought out an fellowship in ophthalmology at Columbia University in which she discovered useful research. </p>
